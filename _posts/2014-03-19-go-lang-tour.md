I recently decided to work my way throught the [Go Tour](http://tour.golang.org/) after seeing multiple indications of Go's progress as a language.

Most of the tour was very straightforward and simple to program, however I had some trouble with examples 63 and 73 and ended up needing to dig through a bunch of documentation and find external examples to prove to myself how stuff was working. So that others don't fall into any of the traps that I did, I will document how I went about solving these two examples in the tour.
